# âš¡ HTMQ

HTMQ allows you to supercharge your html with some useful and shorthand attributes.
Every attribute is prefixed with `q-`, and the attributes available to date are:

-   q-click
-   q-hover
-   q-loop
-   q-search
-   q-shortcut

Documentation for all these attributes is available [here](https://htmq.vercel.app).

You can install htmq (~4kb), via the CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmq" defer></script>
```
