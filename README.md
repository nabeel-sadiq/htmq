# âš¡ HTMQ

HTMQ is an npm package that supercharges your html with some useful and shorthand attributes.
Every attribute is prefixed with `-s`, and the attributes available to date are:

-   s-click
-   s-hover
-   s-loop
-   s-search
-   s-shortcut

You can install htmq (~4kb), via npm or more preferably, via the CDN:

npm install htmq
```

```html

```
